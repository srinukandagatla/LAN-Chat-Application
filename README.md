#LAN Chat Application
A lightweight, Java-based real-time chat application designed for Local Area Networks (LAN). This project demonstrates the use of core Java concepts like socket programming,
multi-threading, and graphical user interfaces (GUI) to build an interactive communication tool.
Features

    Real-Time Messaging: Send and receive messages instantly with other users in the same network.
    Online User Display: A dynamic list shows all active users connected to the chat room.
    User-Friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive GUI with separate sections for the chat window, online users, and message input.
    Multi-User Support: Handles multiple users concurrently without performance degradation.
    Lightweight: No additional libraries or frameworks required; works out of the box with core Java.
    
    Technologies Used
    
    Language: Java
    Networking: Java Socket Programming for server-client communication
    GUI: Java Swing
    Multi-threading: For managing multiple client connections seamlessly
    Prerequisites

    Ensure Java JDK 8 (or higher) is installed on all participating systems.
    All systems must be connected to the same Local Area Network (LAN).
