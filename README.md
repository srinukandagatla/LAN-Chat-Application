**LAN Chat Application**

A simple yet powerful Java-based real-time messaging application that facilitates communication within a Local Area Network (LAN). This project demonstrates the use of socket programming, multi-threading, and a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing.

**🛠️ Features**
    Real-Time Chat: Instantly send and receive messages with users in the same network.
    Dynamic User List: Displays all currently active users in real-time.
    User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design with separate sections for the chat window, user input, and online users.
    Scalability: Supports multiple clients connected simultaneously to the same server.
    Lightweight & Portable: Written in pure Java; requires no additional dependencies.
